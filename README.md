# Shaun Rainer - Web Developer
I have been web developing for a number of years, building my first website at the age of 14.
Starting off building simple sites for fun using Microsoft Front Page then later moving on to
Dreamweaver to now using PHP Storm.
At the age of 15 Using HTML/CSS and PHP/MySQL I built a small social network and local events
website.
